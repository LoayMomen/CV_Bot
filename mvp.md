Got it ✅ — I’ll strip away all the sample code and just keep the **conceptual, architectural, and process details** for your resume scanner project. Here’s the refined plan, fully high-level and implementation-free:

---

# Resume Scanner — Real-Life Project Plan

## 1. High-Level Architecture

* **Frontend (Next.js + React)**:

  * Job description editor
  * Questionnaire UI (auto-generated + editable)
  * Resume upload (PDF/DOCX)
  * Candidate ranking dashboard
* **Backend (FastAPI)**:

  * Endpoints for job creation, resume upload, parsing, scoring
  * Background tasks for embeddings & heavy processing
* **Resume Parser Service (Python)**:

  * Extracts text and structured fields from resumes
  * Handles scanned PDFs (OCR fallback)
* **Embeddings + Vector Store**:

  * Generate embeddings for resumes and job descriptions (DeepSeek API)
  * Store in FAISS/Milvus/Weaviate for similarity search
* **Relational Database (Postgres)**:

  * Store users, jobs, resumes, candidate scores, audit logs
* **Cache/Queue (Redis)**:

  * Speed up repeated requests and run async tasks
* **Security**:

  * JWT auth for HR accounts
  * Encrypted storage for sensitive resume data

---

## 2. Core Flows

### A. Job Creation

* HR pastes job description or fills a form.
* LLM auto-fills questionnaire with skills, years of experience, education, certifications.

### B. Resume Upload

* Resume is uploaded, parsed into structured fields and text chunks.
* Embeddings generated for each chunk.

### C. Matching & Ranking

* Resume embeddings compared to job embeddings.
* Scores calculated using weighted formula (semantic similarity, keyword overlap, experience, education).
* Candidates ranked with explanations.

### D. Explainability

* Show HR the snippets from the resume that triggered matches.
* Provide LLM-generated natural language explanation.

---

## 3. Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TailwindCSS
* **Backend**: FastAPI, Pydantic, Uvicorn
* **LLM/Embeddings**: DeepSeek API
* **Vector Store**: FAISS (MVP), Milvus/Weaviate (scalable)
* **Database**: PostgreSQL
* **Queue/Cache**: Redis
* **Resume Parsing**: pdfminer, python-docx, OCR with Tesseract

---

## 4. Data Model (Simplified)

* **Users**: HR/admin accounts
* **Jobs**: Job description, questionnaire, embeddings
* **Candidates**: Parsed resume text, structured fields
* **Candidate Chunks**: Small sections of resumes, each with an embedding
* **Scores**: Candidate vs. job match, category breakdown, explanations

---

## 5. Resume Parsing Pipeline

1. Extract text from PDF/DOCX.
2. OCR fallback if text not extractable.
3. Split into sections: skills, experience, education, etc.
4. Normalize data (e.g., skill synonyms, education degrees).
5. Break into chunks for embeddings (150–400 tokens each).

---

## 6. Scoring & Ranking Logic

* **Semantic similarity**: Compare resume chunks to job description.
* **Keyword overlap**: Must-have vs. nice-to-have skills.
* **Experience**: Compare required vs. actual years.
* **Education**: Match required degrees/certifications.

Weighted formula example (conceptual, no code):

* 45% semantic similarity
* 30% keyword overlap
* 15% experience
* 10% education

---

## 7. LLM Prompt Use Cases

1. **Auto-generate questionnaire**: From a job description, create structured requirements (skills, education, years, sample questions).
2. **Result explanation**: Generate natural-language rationale for why a candidate matched.

---

## 8. User Interface (UX)

* Job page: Description + auto-generated questionnaire (editable).
* Resume upload: Drag & drop, parsing preview.
* Candidate list: Scores, category breakdowns, snippets.
* Filters: Min score, skill presence, years of experience.
* Shortlist export: CSV or ATS integration.

---

## 9. Privacy & Security

* Encrypt resumes at rest.
* Provide anonymized mode (mask PII for blind screening).
* Support deletion on request.
* Secure API keys and rate limits.

---

## 10. Evaluation & Metrics

* Precision\@k: HR acceptance rate for top-k candidates.
* Recall: Coverage of must-have skills.
* A/B test ranking thresholds.
* Collect HR feedback for supervised improvements.

---

## 11. MVP Roadmap

**Week 1**: Backend skeleton + database schema + job creation flow.
**Week 2**: Resume parsing + embeddings + initial scoring.
**Week 3**: Candidate ranking UI + explanations.
**Week 4**: OCR fallback + polish + demo deployment.

Post-MVP: Supervised re-ranking, ATS integration, multi-language support, blind-screening mode.

## 12. Missing Components & Considerations

### A. Critical Technical Gaps
* **Error Handling & Resilience**:
  * LLM API failure retry logic with exponential backoff
  * Resume parsing error recovery (corrupted files, unsupported formats)
  * Database connection failure handling
  * Graceful degradation when vector store is unavailable

* **API Management**:
  * Rate limiting strategy for DeepSeek API calls
  * Request queuing during high traffic
  * API cost monitoring and budgeting alerts
  * Fallback embedding models if primary API fails

* **File Management**:
  * Resume file size limits and validation (max 10MB, supported formats)
  * Virus/malware scanning for uploaded files
  * File storage cleanup policies
  * Corrupt file detection and user feedback

### B. Operational Requirements
* **Monitoring & Observability**:
  * Application health checks and uptime monitoring
  * Performance metrics (parsing time, scoring latency)
  * Error tracking and alerting system
  * Resource usage monitoring (CPU, memory, storage)

* **Deployment & Infrastructure**:
  * Docker containerization strategy
  * CI/CD pipeline setup
  * Environment management (dev/staging/prod)
  * Database migration strategy for schema changes
  * Backup and disaster recovery procedures

* **Performance & Scaling**:
  * Bulk resume upload functionality (batch processing)
  * Concurrent processing limits
  * Database query optimization
  * Caching strategy for frequently accessed data
  * Performance benchmarks and scaling thresholds

### C. Enhanced User Experience
* **Progress & Feedback**:
  * Real-time progress indicators for long operations

  * Candidate communication workflow
  * Advanced filtering and search capabilities

### D. Business Logic Extensions

  * Bias detection and mitigation in scoring
  * GDPR compliance specifics (right to be forgotten)
  * Data retention policies and automated cleanup
  * Export capabilities for legal compliance

* **Quality Assurance**:
  * A/B testing framework for ranking algorithms
  * HR feedback collection system
  * Model performance tracking over time
  * Manual override capabilities for scores

### E. Security Enhancements

  * Session management and timeout
  * Multi-factor authentication
  * IP whitelisting for enterprise clients

### F. Integration Readiness
* **External Systems**:
  * ATS (Applicant Tracking System) integration APIs
  * Email notification service integration

Do you want me to now **map this into a concrete file/folder structure** for implementation (without code) — e.g., how the `backend/`, `frontend/`, `services/`, `db/` folders would be organized — so you have a ready-to-go project skeleton?
